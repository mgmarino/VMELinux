Developed for Linux 2.6.x kernels

This code was originally begun and based off of work done on vmelinux (http://www.vmelinux.org).  
However, a significant amount of updating and rewriting has occurred to the code so that the driver is
essentially brand new.  I have retained the credit to the original developers of vmelinux
(Huggins and Wyrick) as their code provided the inspiration for this.  

This code runs on 2.6.x kernels.

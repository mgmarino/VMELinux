This C program is a Linux Kernel version 2.2.X and 2.4.x module.
UPDATE: This program works for linux kernels 2.6.x (Michael Marino)

To compile and install the VMELinux Universe Driver:

Make sure you are the root user.

1) verify you are in the driver directory

2) type "make"

3) type "make install"
   Look at the messages output.  If you are running a redhat variant, the 
   make command will automatically insert the service to be started at boot time.
   If you are running CRUX, it should automatically insert the service as well.
   
   If you are not running a redhat variant or CRUX, it will say so. 
   If this is true, you have to modify the appropriate conf file (probably rc.conf) 
   to load this at boot.  

4) type "make check" to verify that the module is running.  An error message means
   the install failed.
